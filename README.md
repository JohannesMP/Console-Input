# Console-Input
Allows for cross-platform reading of keypresses with a simple header file. Contains a very small test application to print out the key code of a given key and the character for it. Nothing has to be built - the file you are looking for is `console-input.h` in the Source folder!

#### Building the test
- Build Test on windows for VS2015 using `Build.bat` or by running `Build/premake5 vs2015`
- Build on linux with `Build.sh` or by running `Build/premake5 gmake`
